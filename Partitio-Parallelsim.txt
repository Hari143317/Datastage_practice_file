Types Of JObs: sequence,parallel,server
Difference between server and parrale jobs?
2 node configration
Ans: s
server jobs:
single node 
sequential
sourcefile--->transformer--->dataset
1
2
3
4
5
6

parallel Jobs:
 more than 1 node (multiple nodes)
 parallel execute based on partition techniques.
 
 What is meant by parallelism?
Ans: There are 2 types of Parallelism
1.Pipeline Parallelismline by line one after another if the data moved from source to tarnsformation 2nd record will be processed.
Ex: sourcefile--->transformer--->dataset
1
2
3
4
5
6
2.partition parallelism:
parallelly data will processed based nodes and partition techniques.

Partition Techniques:
2 Node configuration file
1st node : node1 2nd: node2

Job design:

sequfentialfilestage------>Transformerstage---> filter-------> Oracle
                               sort                same
a)Key less:     
1. Round robin:
 Node1:
 10
 13
 16
 19
 Node2:
 12
 15
 18
2. Random
node1:
10
12
15
18
node2:
13
16
19
11

3. Same
11
13
16
19



4. Entire:

it is used for lookup stage for reference link.

Node2:

b)Key based: Data should be in sorted orde asc/desc
1. Hash: grouping the same data and processing into the nodes.

12
13
14
15

Node1:
10

Node2:
12
14
14

2. Modulus:
partion= mod(key_value/nmberodpartition)
p=mod(10/2)
Node1:
10
12
13
node2:
3. Db2

4. Range
node1:
sal= range in between 2000 to 5000
node2:
10k to 25k

Q: what is the difference b/w hash and modulus?
hash:It will support for interger/number or varchar(string) key columns.
Modulus: It will support only Integer/number  key column.
